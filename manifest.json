      "concept": "You receive a mysterious clockwork invitation that ticks louder and louder in your pocket. First clip: pulling out the golden gear-shaped card as it suddenly unfolds itself. Second clip: the gears spelling out \"GRAIN DISTRICT PARTY\" before the floor beneath you gives way. Third clip: you're tumbling through a avalanche of wheat pouring from broken clockwork silos, gears spinning everywhere. Fourth clip: you land in a massive pile of grain where hundreds of tiny clockwork mice are having a rave, and they all freeze and stare directly at you.",
      "clips_and_flow": "# CLOCKWORK INVITATION BREAKDOWN\n\n## CLIPS:\n\n1. **Extreme close-up macro lens shot, shallow depth of field.** First-person POV as trembling hands pull a golden gear-shaped invitation from a coat pocket, the intricate brass cogs and springs visibly ticking and whirring with increasing intensity. The card suddenly begins to unfold itself mechanically, each gear clicking into place with precision as golden light emanates from between the gears. **SFX: Rapid ticking crescendos into mechanical whirring and metallic clicks.** Cinematic lighting with warm golden highlights catching on the polished brass surfaces, moody shadows creating high contrast against the dark pocket fabric.\n\n2. **Wide-angle POV shot transitioning to low-angle perspective.** The invitation's gears spin rapidly and rearrange themselves to spell out \"GRAIN DISTRICT PARTY\" in ornate mechanical letters that lock into place with satisfying clicks. The floor beneath suddenly fractures into hexagonal brass tiles that fall away into darkness, revealing spinning clockwork mechanisms below. **SFX: Metallic spelling-out clicks followed by grinding gears and cracking floor tiles.** High contrast dramatic lighting with shafts of golden light piercing through the collapsing floor, creating a dreamy yet ominous atmosphere.\n\n3. **Dynamic tracking shot following downward motion, wide-angle lens capturing chaos.** First-person POV tumbling through a massive avalanche of golden wheat grains pouring from shattered clockwork silos, enormous brass gears spinning and grinding all around as wheat cascades like waterfalls. The camera spins and rotates to capture the disorienting descent through the grain storm, with mechanical components and cogs whizzing past in all directions. **SFX: Rushing grain sounds like ocean waves, grinding metal gears, whistling wind.** Cinematic golden hour lighting filtering through the wheat particles, creating a dreamy ethereal ambiance with lens flares and particle effects.\n\n4. **Crane shot descending into close-up, then extreme wide shot reveal.** First-person POV landing with a soft impact into an enormous pile of grain, camera stabilizing to reveal hundreds of tiny clockwork mice with glowing red eyes dancing and celebrating around miniature brass DJ equipment and spinning gear decorations. All the mechanical mice simultaneously freeze mid-dance and slowly turn their heads in perfect synchronization to stare directly at the camera with clicking, focusing eyes. **SFX: Muffled landing thump, tiny electronic rave music abruptly cuts to silence, hundreds of simultaneous mechanical clicks and whirs.** Moody neon lighting with pulsing reds and golds from the mice's eyes and party equipment, high contrast noir atmosphere with dramatic shadows, cinematic composition emphasizing the uncanny frozen moment.\n\n## FLOW:\n\n1\n\n2 SEGUE FROM 1\n\n3 SEGUE FROM 2\n\n4 SEGUE FROM 3",

        "Extreme macro close-up shot at f/2.8 with razor-thin depth of field, first-person POV of trembling hands extracting an ornate golden gear-shaped invitation from a dark wool coat pocket, intricate brass clockwork mechanisms visible on its surface with tiny cogs actively rotating and springs coiling, the metallic card catching dramatic chiaroscuro lighting with warm amber highlights glinting off polished brass teeth and beveled edges while deep shadows pool in the mechanical recesses. Shot on cinema-grade lens with bokeh background blur of dark fabric texture, the invitation beginning its first mechanical movement of self-unfolding, a sliver of golden luminescence starting to emerge from between interlocking gears, photographed with the tactile precision of luxury watch photography meets steampunk aesthetic, moody and mysterious atmosphere with particles of dust floating in the shaft of golden light.",
        "Wide-angle POV shot at 24mm focal length capturing an ornate golden clockwork invitation held at chest height, its intricate brass gears rapidly spinning and mechanically rearranging themselves into elaborate Victorian-style letters spelling \"GRAIN DISTRICT PARTY\" with each gear locking into place with precision, shot from slightly above looking down at a hexagonal brass-tiled floor beginning to fracture and separate beneath, revealing glimpses of massive spinning bronze clockwork mechanisms in the shadows below. Dramatic chiaroscuro lighting with sharp shafts of warm golden sunlight piercing diagonally through the frame from upper left, creating high-contrast illumination on the polished brass surfaces and deep amber glows reflecting off the metallic tiles, while casting long geometric shadows across the fragmenting floor. Shallow depth of field at f/2.8 keeps the transforming invitation razor-sharp in the foreground while the cracking floor softly blurs, cinematic steampunk aesthetic with photorealistic metal textures showing fine engravings and weathered patina, atmosphere thick with suspended brass dust particles catching the light, ominous yet mesmerizing mood.",
        "First-person POV at the exact moment of beginning the tumbling descent, wide-angle 24mm lens at f/2.8 capturing the initial cascade of thousands of golden wheat grains exploding from massive shattered brass clockwork silos above, enormous industrial gears (3-4 feet diameter) with intricate teeth patterns spinning violently in the foreground and background creating depth, warm golden hour sunlight streaming through the grain avalanche creating god rays and atmospheric volumetric lighting with amber and honey tones, slightly motion-blurred wheat particles in immediate foreground suggesting downward velocity, sharp focus on the nearest spinning gear mechanisms with visible rivets and patina, cinematic composition with dramatic diagonal lines of falling grain creating dynamic movement, rich contrast between dark mechanical bronze elements and luminous golden wheat, photorealistic rendering with film grain texture and subtle lens flares, disorienting 15-degree camera tilt suggesting loss of balance.",
        "First-person POV extreme wide-angle shot (14mm lens, f/2.8) capturing the immediate aftermath of landing in a massive golden grain pile, with hundreds of tiny brass and copper clockwork mice frozen mid-dance across the undulating wheat surface, their glowing crimson LED eyes creating pools of red light in the darkness. Moody cyberpunk noir lighting with dramatic chiaroscuro—pulsing neon reds and warm golds from miniature brass DJ turntables and spinning gear decorations illuminate mechanical mice with visible gears, springs, and articulated joints, all positioned in various dance poses but completely motionless, their heads turned in perfect unison toward camera with crystalline glass eyes that reflect light like camera lenses focusing. Shot from low angle partially submerged in grain with sharp focus on nearest mice in foreground (photorealistic macro detail on brass engravings and weathered metal textures) while background fades into atmospheric haze filled with floating grain dust particles catching colored light, creating volumetric god rays; cinematic composition with rule-of-thirds framing emphasizing the uncanny valley horror of synchronized mechanical attention in an underground rave cavern."
